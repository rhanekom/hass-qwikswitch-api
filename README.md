# QwikSwitch API custom component for Home Assistant

A custom component for Home Assistant that uses the [QwikSwitch API](https://qwikswitch.com/doc/) to discover devices and manage state.

To use this component you will need the [Wifi Bridge](https://www.qwikswitch.co.za/products/wifi-bridge).  This component is an online integration, i.e. polling over the internet).

The [QwikSwitch QSUSB integration included in Home Assistant core](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/qwikswitch/) requires a USB modem, but does offer local control. The Wifi Bridge does not offer local integration.
